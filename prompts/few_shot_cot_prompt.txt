Answer the question **step by step** and provide the final answer at the end, each step should end with **<end>** and put your final answer within $\boxed{}$. Below are two examples:
Question: BoatsRUs built 7 canoes in January of this year and then each subsequent calendar month they built twice the number of canoes they had built the previous month. How many total canoes were built by BoatsRUs by the end of May of this year?
### Step1: To find the result of the total number of canoes built by BoatsRUs by the end of May, I need to find the number of canoes built in each month from January to May and then add them up. <end>
### Step2: To find the number of canoes built in each month, I need to use the formula for the number of canoes built in a given month, which is the number of canoes built in the previous month times 2. <end>
### Step3: So, the number of canoes built in January is 7, the number of canoes built in February is 7 times 2, which is 14, the number of canoes built in March is 14 times 2, which is 28, the number of canoes built in April is 28 times 2, which is 56, and the number of canoes built in May is 56 times 2, which is 112. <end>
### Step4: Now, I can add up these numbers to get the total number of canoes built by BoatsRUs by the end of May: 7 plus 14 plus 28 plus 56 plus 112, which is 217. <end>
### Final Answer: The answer is: $boxed{217}$.
Question: Find the number of blue circles in the figure.
### Step 1: To find the result of the number of blue circles, I need to interpret the figure. The figure is a Venn diagram with two labeled sets: - One set labeled "blue" contains all the shapes that are blue in color. - The other set labeled "circle" contains all the shapes that are circular in shape. The overlapping region of the Venn diagram contains shapes that are both blue and circular. <end>
### Step 2: The overlapping region contains shapes that meet both criteria: Blue color and Circle shape. From the diagram: - There is **one blue circle** in the overlapping region. <end>
### Final Answer: The answer is: $boxed{1}$.
